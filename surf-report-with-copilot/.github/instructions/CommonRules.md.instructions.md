# Common TypeScript Rules for the Repository

All HTML forms must be implemented using Shadcn UI components to ensure consistency and accessibility across the application. Avoid using native HTML form elements directly. If Shadcn UI is not installed, then install it with the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest install
```
